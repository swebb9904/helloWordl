// This assignment will walk us through the usage of custom types in Swift



/*
1. Create a Class that represents a car with at least 2 properties and 1 instance method

 */

//Your code here:







/*
 2. Create a Class that subclasses from the above Car class called Truck. Provide at least 1 more property and 1 more instance method

 */

// Your Code here:






/*
 3. Create a Protocol called Vehicle with a function drive
 
 
 */

// Your Code here:




/*
 4. Add an extension to the car class Car class to provide protocol conformance to the Vehicle protocol
 
 
 */
// Your code here:





/*
 
 5. Create a Struct Boat that conforms to the Vehicle protocol as well
 */
// Your code here:



/*
 6. Create an enum called VehicleClass that specifies 2 vehicle types, car and boat, each with an associated value of type Vehicle. Give the car type an associated value of a Car (from above), and the boat type an associated value of a Boat (from above)
 */
// Your code here:





/*
 7. Define a variable of the enum type VehicleType. Use a switch statement to take in this vehicle variable and call the Vehicle protocol method drive(). Test this with a car enum value input and a boat enum value input
 */

// Your code here:



// 8a. Create a Protocol automobile with at least 1 method









// 8b. Create a Protocol Car with with at least 1 property and 2 methods









// 9. Creat a class Truck that conforms to both Car and Automobile









// 10a. Create a class Boat with at least 1 property and 1 function NOT defined in the automobile protocol
