/*
 Problem Statement:
 We will be practicing using collections, constants and variables, operators, optionals, and data types by going through a series of short questions surrounding a virtual classroom
 */


// Instructions: go through the following 6 mini problems, adding code after the blocks that read // Your code here:


// 1. Define variables or constants for the first name, middle name, last name, and highest test score of the year so far for a sample student. Please assign values for these items.






// Your code here:


// 2. The student was able to get some extra credit! This allows them to increase their score value from part 1. by 20 percent! Please create a new variable storing the updated score, using the old variable to directly calculate the new score. Ex. if I have var score = 10, a 30 % increase would 1.3 * score.

// Your code here:


// 3. Below is a set of class pet types allowed by the School Board. Please add one more type to the set.
var allowedClassPets: Set<String> = ["Hamster", "Guinea Pig", "Frog", "Snake"]

// Your code here:



// 4. Below are 3 students packaged into tuples with their name and test score. Create an array or Ints containing just the scores in descending order.
let studentOne = (name: "Alex", score: 10)
let studentTwo = (name: "Navdeep", score: 15)
let studentThree = (name: "Christina", score: 20)


// Your code here:


// 5. Based on the scores from part 4., the students have been awarded grades. Alex received a C, Navdeep a B, and Christina an A. Create a dictionary storing Key-Values pairs of this data, with the key being the name and the value being the grade. Note: the grade must be of type Character for full credit.

// Your code here:


// 6. Navdeep got some extra credit! The teacher bumped up his grade in the class from a B to an A. Without creating another dictionary, edit the dictionary from part 5 to replace Navdeep's grade of B with an A
